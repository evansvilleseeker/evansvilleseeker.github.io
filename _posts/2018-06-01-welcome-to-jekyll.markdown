It's official. Evansville Seeker has launched its news operation. 

This is where we would talk about how we would cover news in our community. 

We will do investigations. We will do the data and stuff.

We will pick up where other local news outlets have left off and so forth.

Also, give us your money. Think about an amount of money you're comfortable parting with and add 10 percent to that amount.
